## Phase-1 project

## PROJECT 1.0

This is a bus ticket - booking website for a public service vehicle company called MASH POA that allows users to book bus tickets at the comfort of their homes and locations online . The website allows users to see departure and arrival times of different buses as well as the ticket prices for each bus and how many tickets remain after each purchase.The website is a simple one that solves the issue of locals having to travel long distance to the city where the company offices are and do the booking physically .
